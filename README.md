## Functionality
The Google Book Search app allows users to type in the title of a book and see whether it's available on Google Store.

Once the user has clicked search for the book they want to find, similar or relevant books will appear in a list using the Google API.

Beside each book and the blurb, two buttons display: View and Save.

View will take the user to a Google Store page where they can view or buy the book.

Save will allow the user to save the book to their list of saved items.
